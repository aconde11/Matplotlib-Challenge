I used this site for help https://joekell.github.io/PharmaceuticalDataPlots

The bar graph showed that the drug regimen Capomulin has teh max mice number and Zoniferol has the smaller mice number. When removing duplicates the total number of mice is 248.
The correlation between the mouse weight, and average tumor volume is .84, meaning that when mouse weight increased, so did the average tumor volume. 
The regression analysis helped understand how much the average tumor volume will change when weight changed. The R-squared value is .709, which means 70% the model fit the data, which is good to predict the data from the model.
Capomulin and Ramicane showed more success in reducing tumors.
